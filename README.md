This Repo focus on creating a dashboard showcasing the current situation of Singapore Healthcare through Tableau


## Introduction
The Healthcare system of Singapore has improved tremendously ever since Singapore has gained her independence from the British Colony. 
As of right now, we are ranked 4th on the global level by Bloomberg 2017 Index. 
The Healthcare model that Singapore adopted is unique as compared to the rest of the world. 
Singaporeans pay most of their healthcare expenses through their own pockets. 
Singapore has also one of the low costs of maintaining the Healthcare system in the world without compromising on the quality of healthcare given to Singaporeans [2]. Having said that, thanks to the strong economic development of Singapore, the population of Singapore becomes more affluent, leading to a more developed society. 
As such, people are marrying later and having lesser children, leading to an aging society. 
The increase in ageing population will play an important role in shaping our demand for healthcare infrastructure, workforce and facilities in Singapore. 
In addition, Singaporeâ€™s population is projected to go up to 6 million by the year of 2020. 
Hence it becomes necessary to identify the influencers of expenditure and be prepared beforehand to handle future needs.
